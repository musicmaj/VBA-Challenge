# VBA-Challenge
This VBA Challenge includes two separate workbooks where I utilized VBA in Excel to create a script to loop through quarterly stock data to output and display the stock ticker symbol, the quarterly change, percentage change, and total stock volume per stock ticker.
Values for the greatest percentage increase, decrease and greatest total volumes are also displayed in each worksheet.
This VBA script is able to run on all worksheets in both workbooks successfully without having to write new scripts for each worksheet or each workbook.

Due to the challenging nature of this assignment, I utilized the following sources outside of the provided resources and script ideas from the course instructor:  learn.microsoft.com, stackoverflow.com, and tutoring assistance from Anna Poulakos, a software engineer.
